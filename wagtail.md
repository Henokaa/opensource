This is a brief introduction to the accessibility concepts mentioned in wagtail.



What is Web Accessibility?
Web accessibility is making sure that the internet (from websites to tools and other platforms) can be accessed by everyone. And by ‘everyone’ we mean all individuals, including those who have cognitive or physical impairments or limitations.

========================================

Why is it important?
it’s not just individuals who suffer disorder who should be given the opportunity to access the internet with ease. In addition to physical disabilities, web accessibility also covers people who have situational disabilities and socio-economic restrictions (e.g. those with lower bandwidth should still be able to access the information or service they need online).
Accessibility is Important for Individuals, Businesses, and the Society
It isn’t hard to see the importance of web accessibility to individuals. Think of a person who has just been through major surgery. Another example is a retiree who is still learning how to navigate the internet from her phone. Making the web accessible to individuals regardless of their status, age, condition, or situation is important to make their web experience a positive and meaningful one.

========================================
WCAG 2.1
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [WCAG 2.0] outlines the recommendations and policies concerning web accessibility.
According to this guideline, web content should be perceivable, operable, understandable, robust, and conforming. It covers everything, from choosing a text alternative to making the keyboard accessible, the content readable and language understandable, and the website or tool compatible with varying devices.
Elements of an accessible website:
•	Perceivable. The WCAG 2.1 makes it clear that the information and user interface components of a website should be presented to users in ways they can perceive.
•	Operable. All the functionality of the website should be operated through a keyboard interface without requiring users for specific timings for individual keystrokes.
•	Understandable. The way the information is presented, as well as the layout of the content, should be easy to understand.
•	Robust. This suggests that the content should be robust enough so it can be interpreted by a wide range of user agents or tools, such as assistive technologies.
•	Conformance. This involves testing the content for accessibility.
===========================================

Evaluating Accessibility
Consider this checklist for creating an accessible website:
Accessibility Statement
This is a declaration of your commitment to making your site accessible to everyone. Your accessibility statement should present your target level of web accessibility and how you are going to achieve it.
Alternative Text for Images
Keyboard Input
Many people with disabilities rely on a keyboard when navigating websites. Make sure that the content is keyboard-focused, meaning all functions can be activated using keyboard shortcuts. Consequently, the components of your site should be arranged in a logical and intuitive manner (left to right, or top to bottom).
Transcripts for Audio
Audio content should have corresponding text alternatives or transcriptions so people with hearing problems can still understand it. Make sure that your users are able to find such transcripts easily. Most transcripts on the web are presented in an HTML format. Add headings or links that will make them more usable and separate sections into headings.
Accessible Forms
Many websites make use of forms to gather customer information when logging in, subscribing to newsletters, commenting or joining discussions, and purchasing. Accessible forms are first and foremost — simple and short. Thus, only ask for the information you need. Next, make use of labels, grouping controls, clear instructions on text alternatives, custom controls, and user notifications.

Usability & Accessibility Testing
Once you have made the necessary adjustments or changes to your website, the next step is to perform an accessibility test. You can do this by asking users for feedback (through surveys) as well as hiring a company to test whether all the components of your site adhere to the ADA requirements. If you choose to work with a third-party, they will be the ones to recruit users with a range of disabilities to test your site, conduct a pilot test to identify issues, and analyze findings and provide helpful recommendations.

 ====================================
Windows High Contrast
 
To access this in windows, do as follows:
•	Select the Start button , and then select Settings.
•	In settings activate Ease of Access > High contrast.
•	To turn on high contrast mode, select the toggle button under Turn on high contrast. Windows may display a “Please wait” screen for a few seconds, after which the colors on the screen change.
High contrast on Windows is an accessibility feature designed to increase text legibility and improve readability. The feature works by enabling the user to select theme colors for a scoped number of semantic elements.
 =====================================
 
What is a good contrast ratio for accessibility?
WCAG recommends a 7:1 contrast ratio for users with vision loss equating to 20/80 vision, but 3:1 for large text since large print with wider character strokes is much easier to read at low contrast. This gives site owners more color choices for large text placement, such as in titles and headers.
What are Blue Lines?
They are essentially interaction blue prints, creating blue lines allows you to think through and document what each thing is in your design, and what it does.

Conclusion
Web accessibility is important to individuals, businesses, and society as a whole.
WCAG 2.1 outlines the guidelines and recommendations for creating an accessible website. Incorporating functionalities that make your site usable and accessible will not only help you connect with more people but will greatly improve your online reputation as well.
